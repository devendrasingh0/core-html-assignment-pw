In HTML, both tags and elements are fundamental components used to structure and define the content of a webpage. Let's explore each of these concepts with examples:

Tag:

A tag is a set of characters enclosed in angle brackets (<>) that define an HTML element. Tags are used to mark the beginning and end of an element and provide instructions to the web browser on how to render the content.
HTML tags are case-insensitive, which means they can be written in uppercase or lowercase letters, but it's a common convention to use lowercase for HTML tags.
Most HTML tags come in pairs: an opening tag and a closing tag. The opening tag contains the tag name, and the closing tag has the same name preceded by a forward slash (</).
Some HTML tags, like <img>, are self-closing and don't have a closing tag.
Example of a tag pair:

<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
In this example:
<p> is the opening tag.
</p> is the closing tag.
The content between the opening and closing tags (This is a paragraph.) forms the element's content.
Example of a self-closing tag:
<img src="image.jpg" alt="An example image">
In this example:
<img> is a self-closing tag.
It's used to display an image on the webpage.
The attributes (src and alt) provide additional information about the image.
Element:

An element is a combination of an opening tag, content, and a closing tag. Together, they define a specific piece of content or structure on a webpage.
Elements can contain text, other elements, or a combination of both.
Elements can be nested, meaning one element can contain other elements.
Example of an element:

<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
In this example:
<h1> is the opening tag.
</h1> is the closing tag.
"Welcome to My Website" is the content of the <h1> element.
The entire construct <h1>Welcome to My Website</h1> is an element.
Example of nested elements:
<div>
    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>We are a company specializing in web development.</p>
</div>
In this example:
<div> is the opening tag for a <div> element.
</div> is the closing tag for the <div> element.
Inside the <div> element, there are two more elements: <h2> and <p>.
Each of these nested elements has its own opening and closing tags and content.
